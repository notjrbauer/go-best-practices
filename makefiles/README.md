Makefiles
=========

Use a common [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) to reduce repetitive tasks.

This can be iterated on/added to as needed on a per project basis, but having a generic one as a good foundation will make it easier for developers to move between projects.

An example can be found at: [examples/Makefile](examples/Makefile)

```
